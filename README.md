# IHSaGMS-submod-for-DIP
As of currently, BrotherMunro's Dreadnoughts Improvement Project mod does not introduce nation-specific hulls or gun models for each of the newly playable nations. This submod gives each nation a slightly different selection of gun models and ship hulls, aiming to make playing these nations more interesting.

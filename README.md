Welcome! If you are here, you have BrotherMunro's Dreadnoughts Improvement Mod and want a slightly mixed up and spicier roster of weapons and hulls for each of the newly playable nations.

##This submod is a work in progress and is not complete yet. Here's what I need to do:
* Fix scale issues on various gun models
* Adjust nation-specific ship rosters
* Complete gun rosters for Chile, Korea, Ottomans/Turkey

All versions of this submod will be saved and backed up here; however this submod was created when 3a10 was the current version and I will not be making versions for any DIP version older than this. You may freely use this in your own work. I appreciate credit but it is not necessary. Some helpful assistance was provided by Rocketlinux Jake_the_Drake, thank you two kindly!

To use, simply download all of these files, then replace the mod's original files with matching names with these.

If you enjoy the submod, consider trying out my other submod for DIP: https://github.com/Omnisxiii2/HMaLSN-submod-for-DIP

Welcome! If you are here, you have BrotherMunro's Dreadnoughts Improvement Mod and want a slightly mixed up and spicier roster of weapons and hulls for each of the newly playable nations.

The Improved Hulls Selection and Gun Model Selection submod for BrotherMunro's Dreadnoughts Improvement Mod adjusts the weapon models and hulls available for each newly added (non-vanilla) nation, making life a bit more visually interesting. Note that this submod may affect or break existing saves.

##This submod is a continual work in progress. It may be a finished working product, but I'm keeping an open mind to potential fixes or changes. Here's what I need to do:
* Fix scale issues on various gun models
* Review current gameplay experiences through playtesting to make balance/content adjustments as necessary

All versions of this submod will be saved and backed up here; however this submod was created when 3a10 was the current version and I will not be making versions for any DIP version older than this. You may freely use this in your own work. I appreciate credit but it is not necessary. Some helpful assistance was provided by Rocketlinux Jake_the_Drake, thank you two kindly!

To use, simply download all of these files, then replace the mod's original files with matching names with these.

If you enjoy the submod, consider trying out my other submod for DIP: https://github.com/Omnisxiii2/HMaLSN-submod-for-DIP
